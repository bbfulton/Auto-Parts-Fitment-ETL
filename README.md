# PartsETL
Another ETL project that takes warehouse data and transforms it for use in online CMS

Because R is such a powerful coding language for statistics, data science and machine learning, it's also quite useful for reading and transforming data no matter what the end goal may be.  This is another Extract-Transform-Load project that takes product information from our point of sale system and builds a new table that can be uploaded to our online store content management system (Magento).  Magento is very particular about how it accepts data, but fortunately, R let's us format everything in the exact way that's required.
